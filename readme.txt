== Description ==
Instant, easy embed of <a href="http://SwiftForm.com" target="_new">http://SwiftForm.com</a> Web-Forms, which is a drag-and-drop forms editor.

**SwiftCloud is a business productivity suite, focused on marketing and sales. Try it free, then embed this plugin to see it in action.**

SwiftCloud currently includes:

1. [Swift CRM](https://SwiftCRM.com) - Client Relationship Management
2. [Swift Marketing](https://SwiftMarketing.com)  - including autoresponders and inbound marketing tools
3. [Swift Form](http://SwiftForm.com)  - a drag-and-drop forms editor for lead capture, inbound marketing, helpdesk forms, job applications, and more.

If you just want to make a nice looking form that emails you each time it is filled out, try it out. SwiftCloud is "freemium" i.e. we have paid options, but the basics are free.
