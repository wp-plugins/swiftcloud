1. Upload the `SwiftCloud` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. To install a webform, login at http://SwiftForm.com (free signup) and click 'new form',
drag and drop fields to create a form, click save, and then remember the number it gives you.
4. Either drop a shortcode like [swiftform id="123"] (change the 123 to your form number) 
5. OR go to appearance >> widgets and drag 'SwiftForm' over into a widget location.
